\noindent{\textbf{Abstract}}\\

This paper proposes a new use of FPGAs in educational robotics field. For that, different robotic behaviors are being developed creating a module library that is useful and giving their user the possibility to work at a high abstraction level. As an example, a self-balance robot is proposed and which explanation consists about this project. Without loosing sight of the initial finality, tools used for that will be in the open source community, as can be IceStudio and IceZum Alhambra.

In first place, and for that reason the most important, I want to thank my family, {\bf Juan, Paqui and María}, who have suffered and enjoyed this project as much as I have, for their credibility, patience, for the moments of weakness supplied with joy and above all for believing in the capacity of someone who never gave reasons for it.\newline
Of course, to my tutors Jose María Cañas Plaza and Encarnación del Castillo Morales who believed and made me believe since the beginning in this project and who have taken me to what I am now. \newline
To my colleagues and friends from Munich, from Eesy-Innovation and Infineon Technologies, who turned last summer into the best summer in the world and who helped me without asking why, because if something has to go right, it would come out all right.\newline
To my friends from Granada whom I have had to say so many times not because of spending time, but because I never get tired of being with them and because they cheered me up with laughter and jokes.\newline
Finally, I remember part of the speech of two professors in my graduation, two professors, who not just for being teachers forget to treat us as people and who saw us cry, laugh and above all, to grow up. And, if I have to take something from here, it's not only the knowledge learned, it's the friends and those people who help you climb when you do not have the strength to keep climbing, people who believe in you even when you've fallen a few times. \newline
{\bf For all of that, thanks.}
